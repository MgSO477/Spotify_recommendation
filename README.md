## Introduction
With millions of songs available online, finding personalized music recommendations is a challenge. This project addresses this issue by analyzing Spotify music data, clustering songs based on audio features, and building a recommendation system that tailors results to user preferences.

The project is presented in a Jupyter Book for interactive exploration and educational purposes.

## Features  
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess and clean Spotify audio feature data.  
- **Clustering Songs:** Group songs based on features such as tempo, energy, and danceability using k-means clustering.  
- **Recommendation Engine:** Recommend songs by matching user preferences to song clusters.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Use machine learning techniques to validate recommendation accuracy.  
- **Interactive Documentation:** Explore the project step-by-step using Jupyter Book.

## How It Works  
1. **Input Data:** Spotify dataset containing audio features like tempo, energy, and acousticness.  
2. **Processing:**  
   - Clean and prepare the data.  
   - Cluster songs using k-means based on audio features.  
3. **Recommendation:**  
   - Use the clusters to suggest songs tailored to user preferences.  
   - Evaluate the system using precision and recall metrics.
